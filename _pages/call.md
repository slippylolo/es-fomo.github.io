## 📝 call for papers

**➡️ Submit your paper on [🤝 OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2023/Workshop/ES-FoMO).** 

We welcome submissions addressing **emerging research questions and challenges associated with foundation model training and inference**. Notably, we accept submissions concerning the entire spectrum of foundation models: from BERT-sized Transformers, to large models with 100B+ parameters. 

Beyond "standard" papers focusing on algorithms and evaluations, we encourage contributions which may be more engineering/systems/code-focused than what is commonly accepted at machine learning conferences, and which feature open codebases. **Implementation details, performance benchmarks, and other nitty gritty details are welcome at this workshop**.


Accepted works will be presented as posters during the workshop, and selected works will be featured as contributed talks.

### 📆 important dates

* **Submission deadline**: **`2023/05/31`** (submit on [**🤝 OpenReview**](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2023/Workshop/ES-FoMO));
* Acceptance notification: **`2023/06/19`**;
* Camera-ready deadline: **`2023/07/07`**.

### ❓ relevant topics
* **Training and inference**:
  * Training and inference of large models;
  * Training on cloud/heterogeneous infrastructure;
  * Training and inference in bandwith/compute/memory/energy-constrained settings;
  * Low-precision training and inference;
  * Decentralized/collaborative training and inference.
* **Algorithms for improved training and inference efficiency**:
  * Model architectures for efficient inference and training; 
  * Large batch training and optimization;
  * Compression algorithms for communication-efficient training.
* **Systems for foundation models**: 
  * System architectures for inference and training;
  * Programming languages and compilers for efficient training and inference;
  * Benchmarks for large models training and inference.

### 🥸 additional details

* **Formatting:** all submissions must be in PDF format, following the [ICML template](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2023/Styles/icml2023.zip). Although this will not be enforced as a hard limit, we recommend submissions to be concise, up to four pages of main content, with unlimited additional pages for references and supplementary. Supporting code may be provided either as a supplementary .zip or as a link to an anonymized repository.
* **Reviewing:** reviewing will be double-blind, so authors should take care to adequately anonymize their submission, especially regarding supplementary code. Reviewers will be instructed to focus on correctness and relevance to the workshop.
* **Non-archival:** this workshop is non-archival and will not result in proceedings; workshop submissions can be submitted to other venues.
* **Dual submission:** we welcome papers that may have been already accepted at ICML 2023 but which are also relevant to this workshop. 
* **Contact:** reach out to `esfomo.workshop@gmail.com`.
